# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the `vergils-nemesis/.github` profile repository. It holds
org-level default configuration for the vergils-nemesis GitHub
organization — the adversarial-testing counterpart to the
[VERGIL](https://github.com/vergil-project) methodology. It contains
the org profile README (the MIMIR page), default community health
files (issue templates, PR template, CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md,
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, SUPPORT.md), and the repo's own CI workflow.

This is a documentation-only repository. There is no application code,
no Python package, no build artifacts, and nothing to release.

## Memory management

Memory is allowed with human approval. The authoritative policy is in
the user's global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — agents must propose memory
writes and suggest a destination (repo memory, global CLAUDE.md, or
plugin/skill issue) before writing. See that file for the full
workflow.

Available skills:
- `/vergil:memory-init` — set up or update the policy header
  in a project's `MEMORY.md`.
- `/vergil:memory-audit` — structured collaborative review
  of memory files.

## Parallel AI agent development

This repository supports running multiple Claude Code agents in parallel via
git worktrees. The convention keeps parallel agents' working trees isolated
while preserving shared project memory (which Claude Code derives from the
session's starting CWD).

**Canonical spec:**
[`vergil-tooling/docs/specs/worktree-convention.md`](https://github.com/vergil-project/vergil-tooling/blob/develop/docs/specs/worktree-convention.md)
— full rationale, trust model, failure modes, and memory-path implications.
The canonical text lives in `vergil-tooling`; this section is the local
on-ramp.

### Structure

```text
<project-root>/                              ← sessions ALWAYS start here
  .git/
  CLAUDE.md, …                               ← main worktree (usually `develop`)
  .worktrees/                                ← container for parallel worktrees
    issue-<N>-<short-slug>/                  ← worktree on feature/<N>-<short-slug>
    …
```

### Rules

1. **Sessions always start at the project root.**
   Never start Claude from inside `.worktrees/<name>/`. This keeps the
   memory-path slug stable and shared.
2. **Each parallel agent is assigned exactly one worktree.** The session
   prompt names the worktree (see Agent prompt contract below).
   - For Read / Edit / Write tools: use the worktree's absolute path.
   - For Bash commands that touch files: `cd` into the worktree first,
     or use absolute paths.
3. **The main worktree is read-only.** All edits flow through a worktree
   on a feature branch — the logical endpoint of the standing
   "no direct commits to develop" policy.
4. **One worktree per issue.** Don't stack in-flight issues. When a
   branch lands, remove the worktree before starting the next.
5. **Naming: `issue-<N>-<short-slug>`.** `<N>` is the GitHub issue
   number; `<short-slug>` is 2–4 kebab-case tokens.

### Agent prompt contract

When launching a parallel-agent session, use this template (fill in the
placeholders):

```text
You are working on issue #<N>: <issue title>.

Your worktree is: <project-root>/.worktrees/issue-<N>-<slug>/
Your branch is:   feature/<N>-<slug>

Rules for this session:
- Do all git operations from inside your worktree:
    cd <absolute-worktree-path> && vrg-git <command>
- For Read / Edit / Write tools, use the absolute worktree path.
- For Bash commands that touch files, cd into the worktree first
  or use absolute paths.
- Do not edit files at the project root. The main worktree is
  read-only — all changes flow through your worktree on your
  feature branch.
- When you need to run validation, run it from inside your worktree
  (vrg-container-run mounts the current directory).
```

All fields are required.

## Shell command policy

Use `vrg-git` instead of `git` for all git operations. Use `vrg-gh`
instead of `gh` for all GitHub CLI operations. These wrappers enforce
subcommand allowlists, flag deny lists, and credential selection.

Raw `git` and `gh` are denied by the permission model. If a command
is not available through the wrappers, explain the situation to the
human who can run it directly via `! <command>` in the prompt.

## Validation

```bash
vrg-container-run -- vrg-validate
```

This is the **only** validation command. Do not run individual linters,
formatters, or other tools outside of `vrg-validate`. If a tool is not
invoked by `vrg-validate`, it is not part of the validation pipeline.

## Development Commands

### Commits

Use `vrg-commit` for all commits. Raw `git commit` is blocked by the
pre-commit hook.

### Pull Requests

Use `vrg-submit-pr` for all pull requests.

## Architecture

### File Layout

- `profile/README.md` — org profile page (public-facing, renders on
  the github.com/vergils-nemesis landing page) — the MIMIR page
- `profile/Mimir-Banner.png` — org profile banner image
- `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` — default issue templates inherited by all repos
- `pull_request_template.md` — default PR template inherited by all repos
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SUPPORT.md` —
  community health files inherited by repos without their own copies
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — CI for this repo (the nested `.github/`
  is correct — this repo's own workflows live in its own `.github/`
  directory)
- `README.md` — describes what this repo is (not the org profile)

### Inheritance Model

GitHub's `.github` repo provides org-level defaults:
- Standalone files (CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, etc.) inherit per-file
- Template directories (ISSUE_TEMPLATE/) inherit per-directory
  (all-or-nothing)
- LICENSE files do not inherit — each repo must have its own
